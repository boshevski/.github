# Storj - Decentralized Cloud Storage!

<img src="https://github.com/storj/storj/raw/main/resources/logo.png" width="100">

Storj is an S3-compatible platform and suite of decentralized applications that
allows you to store data in a secure and decentralized manner. Your files are
encrypted, broken into little pieces and stored in a global decentralized
network of computers. Luckily, we also support allowing you (and only you) to
retrieve those files!
